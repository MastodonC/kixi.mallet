# kixi.mallet

A Clojure library for interacting with Mallet. This is achieved in two ways currently:

1. A set of boot tasks wrapping Mallet's command-line utility
2. Macros for defining Mallet pipes in Clojure

The boot tasks are designed to be chained with other tasks, facilitating ad-hoc exploratory analysis.
